# eathealthy
A web-based healthy diet planner with social features

This has three purposes:
1. To bring an idea of a system to plan your weekly cooking/shopping/eating in a personalized, healthy way (including "social features") to life
2. As a learning exercise for building database-heavy web applications
3. To serve as an example case for ArangoDB
